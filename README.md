# Software Designer Mindset

Welcome to the Software Designer Mindset Repository, where we dive deep into the principles of crafting better software. Our focus is on creating code that stands the test of time - code that is extendable, clean, and easy to test. This repository serves as a resource for software developers who aspire to enhance their coding practices using Python.

## What's Inside

In this repository, you'll find a collection of examples, best practices, and methodologies that embody the essence of a software designer's mindset:

- **SOLID Principles**: Demonstrations of Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion in Python.
- **Clean Code**: Examples of readable, simple, and concise code that adheres to clean coding standards.
- **Refactoring Techniques**: Strategies for improving existing code without changing its external behavior.
- **Design Patterns**: Implementations of classic design patterns in Python to solve common software design problems.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Techniques to avoid duplication and create reusable code.
